1) I have included some .smf files: cube.smf(the default), wheel.smf. Please type in the name of the files as: cube, wheel to upload the file. "cube" is the defualt value in the open file Edit Text.

2) Use a name for the save file, to save the model. The saved model goes in the same folder. "test" is the default value for the save file Edit Text.

3) Please zoom and drag to make sure the mesh is visible, I could have fixed the axes to the center of the mesh. It might be a good idea for future projects.

4) Please click the decimate button to decimate, change the values and try.

Thanks
